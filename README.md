# Medical_Insurance_Payout
The Medical Insurance Payout project aimed to develop an automated system for estimating annual medical expenditures for new customers of ACME Insurance Inc., facilitating the determination of insurance premiums. Using data encompassing variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence, an in-depth analysis was conducted. Initially, data exploration involved examining the distribution of variables, identifying trends, and assessing correlations between numeric attributes. Noteworthy findings included the observation that charges tend to decrease with a higher number of children and the discernment of distinct charge bands, particularly evident among smokers. Subsequently, categorical variables were transformed into factors for model building, which entailed the division of the dataset into training and testing sets. Linear regression models were constructed, with an iterative approach to enhance model efficacy by eliminating less significant variables. Model evaluation emphasized metrics such as residuals, coefficients, R-squared values, and F-statistics, indicating the predictive power and explanatory capacity of the models. Ultimately, the selected model demonstrated robustness in predicting healthcare charges accurately. Validation through test observations and the creation of dummy data further corroborated the model's reliability, thereby furnishing ACME Insurance Inc. with a valuable tool for estimating medical expenditures and setting insurance premiums effectively.
